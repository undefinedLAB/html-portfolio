<h2>My top 5 movies for 2023</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Mullholand Drive</h3>
<p>
    It's well known that David Lynch's "Mulholland Dr." was assembled from the remains of a cancelled TV series, with
    the addition of some additional footage filmed later. That may be taken by some viewers as a way to explain the
    film's fractured structure and lack of continuity.
    <br />
    I think it's a delusion to imagine a "complete" film lurking somewhere in Lynch's mind — a ghostly Director's Cut
    that exists only in his original intentions. The film is openly dreamlike, and like most dreams it moves uncertainly
    down a path with many turnings.
</p>
<h3>Fargo</h3>
<p>
    The dark and cold weigh down everything, and in the middle, in their warm cocoon, are Chief Marge and her hubby,
    Norm, the painter of ducks. Without them, “Fargo” might have been “In Cold Blood” laced with unseemly humor.
    <br />
    Coens sometimes seem to scorn their characters, but their love for Marge redeems “Fargo.” Marge is the catalyst, and
    her speech at the end is Shakespearean in the way it heals wounds and restores order: “There's more to life than a
    little money, you know. Don't you know that? And here you are. And it's a beautiful day.”
</p>
<h3>The Silence of the Lambs</h3>
<p>
    All of these qualities might not be enough to assure the longevity of “Silence” if it were not also truly
    frightening (“Hannibal” is not frightening, and for all of its box-office success it will have a limited shelf
    life). “Silence” is frightening first in the buildup and introduction of Hannibal Lecter. Second in the discovery
    and extraction of the cocoon in the throat.
    <br />
    Third in the scene where the cops await the arrival of the elevator from the upper floors. Fourth in the
    intercutting between the exteriors of the wrong house in Calumet City and the interiors of the right one in
    Belvedere, Ohio. Fifth in the extended sequence inside Buffalo Bill's house, where Ted Levine creates a genuinely
    loathsome psychopath (notice the timing as Starling sizes him up and reads the situation before she shouts
    “Freeze!”). We are frightened both because of the film's clever manipulation of story and image, and for better
    reasons--we like Clarice, identify with her and fear for her. Just like Lecter.
</p>
<h3>The Revenant</h3>
<p>
    Great film has the power to convey the unimaginable. We sit in the comfort of a darkened theater or our living room
    and watch protagonists suffer through physical and emotional pain that most of us can’t really comprehend. Too
    often, these endurance tests feel manipulative or, even worse, false. We’re smart enough to “see the strings” being
    pulled, and the actor and set never fades away into the character and condition.
    <br />
    What’s remarkable about Alejandro Gonzalez Iñárritu’s “The Revenant” is how effectively it transports us to another
    time and place, while always maintaining its worth as a piece of visual art. You don’t just watch “The Revenant,”
    you experience it. You walk out of it exhausted, impressed with the overall quality of the filmmaking and a little
    more grateful for the creature comforts of your life.
